Questions

Is it possible to write such interpreters?

1. Cons-free interpreter for cons-free language?
    Just no intermediate storage. Can use call stack for lookup/constructing intermediate values.
2. Treeless interpreter for treeless language?
    No intermediate storage, no nested calls.
3. First order tail-recursive interpreter for first order tail-recursive language?
