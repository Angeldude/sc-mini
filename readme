This is the minimal supercompiler. 
The goal is to stress the main features of supercompilation for a working functional programmer.
Its design is an attempt to illustrate the following formula:
	
	Supercompiler = Driving + Positive info propagation + Folding + Simplification + Generalization
	
However, it turns out to be not so easy task. So here we illustrate this formula step by step:

1) Prototype = Driving + Generalization + Folding
2) Deforester = Transformer + Simplification
3) Supercompiler = Deforester + Positive Information Propagation

In order to catch the idea of supercompiler, just look into the following files into the following order:

1) Prototype.hs
2) Deforester.hs
3) Supercompiler.hs
